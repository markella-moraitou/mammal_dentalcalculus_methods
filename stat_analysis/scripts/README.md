## Script directory
### Main scripts
**linear_models.R**: Mainly (generalised) linear models. It also preps the data that the other two scripts use, so it should always be run first, and produces some summary plots.

**machine_learning.R**: Machine learning methods.

**sequencing_outcome.R**: Analyses some metadata of the sequencing output.

## Other
**ggplot_theme.R**: Themes for plotting, sourced in the main scripts.

**renv.lock**: R package versions, can be installed with renv::restore()
